## Course and SFU Policies

### Late Policy and Missed Items


All course elements (including but not limited to) assignments, online and in-class activities, midterm and projects are required to be submitted or completed by the specified due dates. Inability to adhere to these deadlines will lead to a score of zero.  Exceptional situations are considered on an individual basis, subject to the approval of the instructor and supported by legitimate documentation. Refer to accommodations and concessions section below for more details.

### Assignment/Project/Lab Policy

- You may not send the instructor or the TAs draft assignments/project/labs for feedback or review.
- Assignments/labs/projects may be shared/shown in class and online (with no student name/ID)
- Deferrals or extensions will be determined on a case-by-case basis, where a legitimate reason can be determined (e.g. illness, family emergency, etc.) [FAS Academic Concession Applied Sciences form](https://coursys.sfu.ca/forms/apsc-fas-academic-concession/).

### Remarking Policy

If you feel a course item has been incorrectly assessed you may request that the item be remarked. However, before making a remarking request, please complete the following steps:

1. Review the marking rubric and ensure you understand the marking scheme.
2. Review the marking comments and ensure you understand the feedback.
3. Schedule a meeting with the TA to discuss the feedback and marking.
4. If you still feel the marking is incorrect, you may request a re-marking.

#### Request a Remarking

Requests must include a written case for the re-marking and be submitted to the course instructor within 5 business days from receiving the mark.

If accepted for remarking, the item will be re-marked in its entirety by both the course instructor and the marking TA. This may result in a higher, unchanged, or lower mark overall which will be final.

### SFU Student Code of Conduct

The [S 10.05 Student Conduct Policy](https://www.sfu.ca/students/studentconduct/policy.html) defines students' basic responsibilities as academic community members, defines inappropriate student conduct, and provides procedures and outcomes to be invoked if students engage in such behaviour.

### SFU Academic Integrity

- When in doubt, consult with a TA or the instructor first.
- All work submitted must be your own.
- Unless required to use tools as ChatGPT for specific assignments, if you choose to use them, you must:
  - Clearly identify which parts of your work is was used for,
  - Include the prompts used, and,
  - Describe any changes made to the generated output.

*Failure to comply with any of these responsibilities, either knowingly or through negligence, will also be considered an act of plagiarism and subject to the same penalties.*

The [S10.01 Student Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.sfu.ca/policies/gazette/student/s10-01.html) is based on the six core values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage. It is expected that all students abide by this policy for this and all courses at SFU.

### Accommodations and Concessions

Simon Fraser University acknowledges and affirms the rights of students with disabilities to have equal access to the university and to be welcomed as fully participating members of the university community. The [Centre for Accessibility Learning (CAL)](https://www.sfu.ca/students/accessible-learning.html) provides support and advocacy for students with disabilities. Their primary responsibility is determining reasonable academic accommodations for students with documented disabilities. 

Accommodations and Concessions are two different things.

Accommodation refers to special arrangement of learning due to known and documented conditions (e.g., extra time during an exam due to a medical documented medical and/or learning situation). If you believe you are legally entitled for an accommodation, consult with [FAS Advising](https://www.sfu.ca/fas/current-student/advising.html), [Centre for Accessibility Learning](https://www.sfu.ca/students/accessible-learning.html), [Health and Counselling](https://www.sfu.ca/students/health/), and/or the [Human Rights Office](http://www.sfu.ca/humanrights.html).

Concession refers to special arrangement (usually one-time) due to unexpected situations or circumstances preventing students from participating in course-related activities (e.g., changing weights of graded activities due to missing a deadline because of illness). Typically a doctor's note is required to justify a concession, however, this academic year SFU and the FAS faculty have indicated that a [self-declaration form](https://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/students/academicsuccess/academicconcessions/2021%20SFU_AcademicConcession_SelfDeclarationForm.pdf) would be sufficient for minor absences (1-5 days). 

If you believe you are entitled for a concession, **contact the instructor first**. Whether the request is granted or not is subject to the SFU and FAS Faculty policies and regulations, **and also to the instructor's discretion**. Requests must be submitted before the due date of the activities in question or as soon as the situation permits. Refer to [this Academic Concessions article](https://www.sfu.ca/students/academic-success/academic-concessions.html) for details.

### Additional Student Support

A variety of student well-being resources are available through [SFU Student Services Health and Counselling](http://www.sfu.ca/students/health/). In addition to utilizing these, please feel free to contact me with regards to course-specific issues of concern.

We all experience stress and well-being differently. It’s part of being human. Sometimes the challenges will be manageable and other times they may seem overwhelming. Please connect with me or use the resources available to you at SFU to support you and take care of your mental health and well-being or keep these in mind for a peer or friend.

- [Resources to support individual and collective identities](http://www.sfu.ca/students/health/resources/identity.html) are available
- Learn more about [My SSP for 24/7 mental health support](http://www.sfu.ca/students/health/get-support/my-ssp.html) for SFU and FIC students worldwide

### SFU COVID-19 Protocols (last update 4 Jan, 2023)

Based on the Order of the Provincial Health Officer, SFU has suggested a few guidelines for teaching activities. Here are some of the important ones:

- Marks are no longer required and will be a personal choice. If you forget your mask and want one, disposable masks are available from Student Central in Burnaby and at the information desks in Vancouver and Surrey.
- You are encouraged to get vaccinated. There are vaccination clinics on both Burnaby and Surrey campuses.
- Stay home, get tested, and notify the instructor if you feel sick or are experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms -- we'll work it out.
- Be respectful to others. People have different comfort levels and are going through things at their own pace. You never know what someone else is dealing with.
- For more details refer to [SFU FAS COVID-19 Protocols](https://www.sfu.ca/fas/safety/cdp.html#:~:text=Illness%20and%20Academic%20Concessions,recommended%20by%20the%20BC%20CDC.).
