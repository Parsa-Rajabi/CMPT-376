- In the subject line, begin with "CMPT 376W D200:" and then the topic of your message. For example, "CMPT 376W D200: Question about Assignment 1"
- In the body of your message, you must include:
    - Your full name

This information is needed to help us respond more quickly. Missing any of the above might result in undelivered emails or delays in responses.
