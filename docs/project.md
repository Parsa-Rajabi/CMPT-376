## Group Project Expectations

This group project is intended for collaborative teamwork. Each member is expected to:

- **Communicate Regularly**: Stay in touch with fellow members.
- **Attend Meetings**: Ensure presence and attention at all group gatherings.
- **Maintain Professionalism**: Always be respectful and courteous to others.
- **Deliver Quality Work**: Complete tasks on time and to the best capability.
- **Seek and Offer Assistance**: Aid team members and ask for help when needed.
- **Foster Inclusivity**: Create an environment where everyone can voice their opinions.
- **Be Receptive**: Welcome feedback, constructive criticism, and be adaptable.
- **Promote Equal Contribution**: Ensure everyone participates equally in the project.
- **Stay Accountable**: Own up to one's actions and tasks.
- **Engage Actively**: Participate fully in all discussions and activities.
- **Update Regularly**: Inform the team about progress and challenges.
- **Decide Collectively**: Prioritize team decisions over individual ones.
- **Uphold Transparency**: Be honest and clear about all matters.

### Group Project Participation Policy

**Objective**: To ensure equitable contribution in collaborative group tasks and to address non-participation issues effectively.

#### Step 0: Peer Resolution

- **Criteria for Engagement**: Before official intervention, group members are encouraged to address and resolve any perceived non-participation issues internally within the group.
  
- **Evidence Requirement**: If proceeding to the next step, written evidence of attempts to resolve the conflict (such as meeting notes, email correspondence, or other relevant communication) will be required. This evidence serves to demonstrate that the group has made genuine attempts to address the issue before seeking official intervention.

#### Strike 1: Non-participation Initial Consultation

- **Criteria for Identification**: A student may be identified for non-participation if, after attempts at peer resolution, a majority of the group members, supported by the observations of the assigned TA, express continued concerns about the student's contribution levels.

- **Procedure**: The identified student will be required to attend a consultation with the assigned TA and the course instructor.

##### Consultation Outline:

1. Review of specific concerns raised by peers and discussion of the evidence from Step 0.
2. Solicitation of the student's perspective and reasons for observed non-participation.
3. Development of an action plan to rectify non-contribution.
4. Reinforcement of the academic importance of equitable teamwork and responsibility.

- **Record Keeping**: The TA will document the proceedings of the consultation, and this record will be made available to the student and preserved for future reference.

#### Strike 2: Non-participation Individual Project Transition

- **Criteria for Identification**: If, subsequent to the initial consultation, the student is again identified by a majority of their peers (with TA observations in consideration) for inadequate contribution, they will receive a second notification.

##### Procedure:

1. The student will transition from the group project to an independent project. The student will be required to complete an individual project that is comparable in scope and complexity to the group project. The student is expected to complete the individual project within the same time frame as the group project.

- **Notification**: The course instructor will formally communicate the transition and its reasoning to the student in written form, delineating both the rationale and the expectations for the independent project.

##### Additional Notes:

- Open communication with peers and teaching team is crucial. Engaging in early dialogue can mitigate issues effectively.
- In cases of extenuating circumstances, such as significant health or personal challenges, discretion in the application of this policy will rest with the course instructor and department.
- Guidance on effective collaboration and group dynamics will be provided at the outset of the project to establish clear participation expectations.

## Project Milestone 1: Value-Driven Request for Proposal

In this project milestone (M1), you will learn about value-driven design and apply the approach to develop a request for proposal. 

## Scenario

The School of Computing Science at SFU, a department in a public university in BC, has historically used GPA as the only indicator for admissions into the department. With the disappearance of provincial exams, the School of CS is considering adopting an alternative system to rank promising candidates for acceptance. They are also considering the use of artificial intelligence. They issue an open request for proposals to local Canadian companies for an Admissions Management System.

You are the founders of <name your group of 4>, and you aim to bid to become the developer of this project. As part of the bid, you have been tasked to provide a report that will guide the product design and outline risks. This report will be used to determine the feasibility of the project and to guide the development of the system. The report will also be used to determine the ethical implications of the system and to ensure that the system is designed in a way that is consistent with the values of the department, university and the broader community.

## Frameworks and Guidelines

The CS department requires that you ground your proposal in following frameworks and guidelines:
- Foresight into AI Ethics (FAIE) - [Link](https://openroboethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ORI-Foresight-into-Artificial-Intelligence-Ethics-Launch-V1.pdf)
  - This value-driven ethical design toolkit (Steps 1-6) should be used to identify the primary use cases, identify stakeholder groups and understand their values and value tensions. Through this porcess, you will synthesize your findings, along with the ethical risks (Step 8).

- ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct - [Link](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)
  - This code of ethics should be used to guide the development of the system. The department requires that you identify at least 4 principles from the ACM Code of Ethics that are relevant to the development of the system and explain how these principles will be upheld (1 principle per group member).

In addition to the frameworks and guidelines, the department requires that you:
- Conduct research on at least 4 other universities in the world and their admissions processes (1 per group member). 
  - This research should aim to identify the values that are important to these universities and how they are reflected in their admissions processes. Through this process, you will synthesize your findings and identify the values that are important to the broader community. Highlight any value tensions that may exist.

- Describe the algorithm design, the data that will be used and rationale for its selection.
  - The department is keen to understand the ethical implications of the algorithm and the data that will be used. As part of this process, your team will be required to select which data you will require from the prospective students and explain why you need this data. You will also be required to disclose how or what data will playa role in student ranking and selection. While disclosing this information, you will be required to highlight the wieght of each data point and any formulas that will be used to calculate the student's ranking. 
- Some of the data that the department has suggested that you may require includes:
  - High school transcripts with:
    - grades on required courses
    - grades on non-required courses
  - Scholarship and award history
  - Name
  - Gender
  - Photo
  - Phone number
  - Birthdate
  - Social Insurance Number (SIN)
  - School district
  - School name
  - School address
  - Country of citizenship
  - Country of birth
  - English language proficiency
  - Self-reported ancestry
  - Disablity status
  - Extracurricular activities
  - Essay question responses**

    - ** Note: *The department is also considering using an AI-detector for the essay questions. The AI-detector will be used to determine if the essay question responses are authentic and assign a score to the responses called "AI-score". As part of your proposal, you will be required to address how you will or will not use the AI-score for the algorithm design.*
